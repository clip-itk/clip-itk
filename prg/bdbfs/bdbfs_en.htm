	 <h4>1. Why BDBFS?</h4>
<pre>

	And really - there are a lot of analogues, only to author
the following viewers/browsers are known:

	- dbview by Trophimenko ~3k!!!!
	- dbview by Tsarenko ~32k but with edition and search
	- popdbf by Bowen-software - sole TSR, known for me
	- vdbf by Rodionoff, served by a push for development
	- d123 by Deveza
	- dbeditor by Jeff Parnau
	- dbfedit by Lau Preston
	- dbed by Dmitrieff
	- cdbf by Tchehuta
	- dbc by Kresin
	- dbfview by Tibor Kovach
	- clut by Sergio Cocci

	And thus I do not doubt at all, that all is listed not.
It is possible also to use and firm DBU from Nantucket/CA.
It is possible simply to use Fox or there Delphi any ;-).

Nevertheless, BDBFS has a niche.
At a development BDBFS the motto was:
	" We'll make with the chosen base, all that we want! "

You can use practically all functions necessary for daily jobs with bases!
Almost all of them can be called via hot-keys.
Besides it is desirable to have "near at hand" a uniform product for
jobs with different formats of bases and indexes.

	So, BDBFS is able:

	- automatically or optionally to choose a format
	  of indexes and MEMO-fields from Clipper,FoxPro,dBase4,SIX
	- to edit records in a mode BROWSE and EDIT
	- to print chosen base (optionally into file), all or on
	  condition
	- to prepare special report file
	- to modify base structure
	- to optimize base structure
	- to print structure on the printer or into a file
	- to search on a condition LOCATE / CONTINUE
	- to search for a context without binding to fields
	- to search in current field
	- to copy records
	- to copy contents of separate fields from the left and right
	  sides, from below and from above
	- to establish an existing index (or tag)
	- to make a new index (or tag)
	- to make "soft" index search
	- to make wildcard index search
	- Replace on a condition
	- Sum, Count, Total on a condition
	- Delete/Recall on a condition
	- Copy to File / Append from, including on a condition and
	  in text formats. The transformation and renaming of fields
	  is possible. MEMO-fields can be converted to different format.
	- to establish filters
	- to sort base
	- to establish the necessary order and quantity of fields,
	  their headings. The calculated fields are possible! Thus
	  the chosen cut can be printed out and is saved for further use!
	- to calculate any Clipper-expression
	- to set variables
	- to clear at once all record
	- to make Upper and Lower in text fields
	- to change modes of input
	- to work with the mouse
	- to choose all conditions from a history
	- to save and to restore an environment
	- to read ini-files
	- to highlight with color various cells on a condition
	- to work with the own clipboard and Win-clipboard
	- "to freeze" fields for viewing
	- to search for a maximum / minimum
	- to change the disks / directories (Filer)
	- to use long names Win9x

	- and other pleasant trivialities.

	Almost all functions can be called as through hot keys, so
and through the menu.

	Majority of functions is clear for any xBase-man (though
acquaintance with Clipper it is desirable). Some explanatories are below.
Appointments of all hot keys see in HELP and in <a href="#pp1">SUPPLEMENT I.</a>

	  <h4>2. Supported formats of the data.</h4>

<pre>
	The formats of xBase-files are supported basic for today:

		 dBASE3/Clipper		 (DBT/NTX)
		 FoxPro			 (FPT/IDX/CDX)
		 dBASE4			 (DBT/MDX)
		 SIX3			 (SMT/NSX)

	If the base has memo-field, the appropriate driver is defined
automatically. Besides you can set the default driver in an ini-file
or through the menu.

	FoxPro (SIXCDX) driver is default.

	Except for standard Clipper-fields, Float (FoxPro) and
VariField (SIX) are supported.

	You'll be asked for password for SIX ciphered files.

	The new formats of Visual FoxPro, dBASE5, FlagShip, FlexMemo are
supported in "forced" mode <a href="#p34">(see ch.34).</a>

	It is really possible to make support of NDX, if it is necessary
for somebody else.
	Unfortunately, I have not the drivers for other existing
formats (Comix, Inx, etc) :-(.

<p><hr><a name="p3">
	 <h4> 3. Editing of records.</h4>
<pre>

	The initial mode of BDBFS is "VIEW".

	For starting of edition ("BROWSE" mode) it is necessary to press
<font color="blue">Enter</font> in chosen field, then you receive practically Browse of FoxPro:
keys <font color="blue">Up, Down, PgUp, PgDn, Tab, Shift+Tab</font> are acceptable.

	Besides BDBFS passes in a mode "BROWSE" by pressing any "simple"
key depending on a type of a field. For example, if current field's type
is Numeric, entrance in edition passes by pressing any figure, and this
figure at once is displayed.
For an exit from a mode "BROWSE" it is necessary to press <font color="blue">Escape</font> or
<font color="blue">Ctrl+W</font>. As against FoxPro (dBase), for editing a memo-field special
keys don't need to be pressed.

	There are four modes of input in "BROWSE". In "Usual" mode
pressing <font color="blue">Enter</font> in last the field of record simply stops input;
in a mode "Enter/skip" in this case there is a transition to first
field of the following record; in a mode " Lock Enter" pressing
<font color="blue">Enter</font> in any the field results in descent to record below in the
same field. In a mode "Enter/stop" after pressing <font color="blue">Enter</font> there is
a transition to a mode "VIEW". The modes can be switched during input.

	Except for a mode "BROWSE" there is a mode "EDIT". It allows
editing of the fields "vertically". This mode is acceptable from a
mode "VIEW" via hot key <font color="blue">Alt+E</font>(dit).
	It is sometimes convenient to edit a symbolical field exceeding
the size of the screen, as a memo-field. It can be made by pressing a key
<font color="blue">Alt+W</font>(ide).

	You can undo the editing changes (by <font color="blue">Ctrl+U, Alt+BS</font>). Undo
buffer is defined by variable _UndoSize and can be from 0 to 4095 actions
(default 1024). Any global operation (like ZAP, PACK) clears the undo buffer.

</form></center>
<p><hr><a name="p4">
	 <h4> 4. Replace-modes.</h4>
<pre>

	BDBFS supports three Replace modes (all - in current field):
		- constant expression		<font color="blue">Alt+F4</font>
		- varied expression		<font color="blue">Ctrl+F4</font>
		- in the current record		<font color="blue">Alt+R</font>

	A difference between <font color="blue">Alt+F4</font> and <font color="blue">Ctrl+F4</font> we'll explain
on an example:

	Let we stand in a field NUM on 15 records. Now we set the
expression of replacement Recno()+2 and the scope - all records.

	Now the value 17 will be brought in all records by <font color="blue">Alt+F4</font>,
and accordingly 3,5,7.. by <font color="blue">Ctrl+F4</font>.

	Can ask: and what for is necessary for Replace in the current
record, if it is possible simply to correct it? But imagine, that
the field contents 3242756 and it is necessary to multiplicate it on 234.
With <font color="blue">Alt+R</font> it is simple - Field*234.

	<font color="blue">Shift</font> with any replace function (f.e. <font color="blue">Ctrl+Shift+F4</font>),
causes the confirming for each record. It's especially convenient with
varied expression.


<center><form>
<input type="button" value="To content" onClick="window.location.href='#contents'">
</form></center>
<p><hr><a name="p5">
	 <h4> 5.Append/Copy.</h4>


	<font color="blue">F3</font> simply adds the empty record, <font color="blue">Alt+F3</font> - offers to copy
contents of current or last record.

	It is possible also to press <font color="blue">F3</font> in a mode "BROWSE", then new
record will be added with the copied current field.

	It is possible also to make "Append from file" (<font color="blue">Ctrl+F9</font>), and
if in name of a file is specified extension other than DBF, inquiry
of file type will be made: SDF, WITH DELIMITERS, DBF. Same concerns and
to "Copy File" (<font color="blue">Ctrl+F3</font>).

	It is possible also to append from "myself" (current base).

	There are two conflict situations with appending: incompatible
field types and numeric overflow. In BDBFS the disputable concept is now
accepted: the maximal performance of operations. It means, that in the
first case the attempt of types transformation is made, and in second
case the greatest possible number enters in a field. For example, if
field's length is 3 and number is 1200, "999" will be entered.

	At copying a file it is possible to specify only required fields
(via <font color="blue">Alt+F2</font>).

	The transformation and renaming of fields is accessible also
at copying (to base, but not to SDF). It some kind of mini-"Query By
Example". For example, you can set expressions in the list of fields:
	Num, Num*2 AS Double, Upper(Char), CTOF(Char) AS Secret

	The optional "AS" <column_name> clause specifies the heading
for a name in the query output (Num*2 AS Double - the field in new base
will be called "DOUBLE").
	If the target field is not named (word "AS" is not used) and a
select item is expression, a field will be named Exp_??, where ?? -
serial number in the list (is similar FoxPro).

If the expression can't be calculated, it is ignored.

	See also the description of <a href="#pp4dbtrans">function DBTrans().</a>

It is possible also to copy (to transform) the base (table) to a HTML
format. This operation is accessible through the menu File -> Create
HTML. See also description of <a href="#pp4Tb2Html">function Tb2Html().</a>

<p><hr><a name="p6">
	 <h4> 6. SUM.</h4>
<pre>

	The summation always occurs on the current field, it is possible
to choose and calculated field too (see below). It is possible to
summarize numerical or symbolical field (i.e. SUM(VAL(field))).
It is meant, that you know, that you do. It is also possible to use the
function Sum (see below).

<center><form>
<input type="button" value="To content" onClick="window.location.href='#contents'">
</form></center>
<p><hr><a name="p7">
	 <h4> 7. Search an index (tag).</h4>
<pre>

	When you search index key of DATE-type, it is not necessary
to write CTOD. So, is equally correct
		12/03/93  CTOD('12/03/93')  DATE()

	By search on an index of a symbolical type the value should be
concluded in inverted commas. However, if the expression of search begins
with figure or symbol with a code more than 127, the inverted commas are
not obligatory.

	By default the search is conducted in a mode SoftSeek OFF
(SET NEAR - for habitual to FoxPro). To set a mode SoftSeek ON
it is necessary to make
		<font color="blue">Alt+G</font> Set(9, .t.)	// see Set.CH,
or to write =Set(9,.T.) in an ini-file.

	Sometimes it happens necessary to find not unique records in an
index. It can be made by pressing <font color="blue">Alt+2</font>. The cursor thus will be
established on duplicating record.

	The search on a mask (naturally, in an index of a character type)
is accessible also.  The mask is similar DOS. For example, it is possible
to set:

		<font color="blue">Alt+[</font> 'B?LL',	// found: BILL
		<font color="blue">Alt+Shift+]</font>	// found: BYLL

		<font color="blue">Alt+ [</font> 'JO*SON' // found: Johnson,Johanson etc.

<p><hr><a name="p8">
	 <h4> 8. Expressions of conditions.</h4>
<pre>

	At a choice of many functions BDBFS, you will be requested for
condition of selection or searching. It is possible to vary expressions
in such conditions widely enough. Any system and user functions can be
applied. Sole restriction - length expressions (no more than 255 symbols).


<center><form>
<input type="button" value="To content" onClick="window.location.href='#contents'">
</form></center>
<p><hr><a name="p9">
	 <h4> 9. Set Fields.</h4>
<pre>

	By Ctrl+F2 you can set the contents, names(headings), show format
and order of fields. The contents of a field can be any allowable expression.
The symbols of national alphabets in the contents now are allowable only
in russian version (see NATIONAL.TXT).

	Example:
	Contents of a field: If(Deleted(), [Yes], [No])
	Name: Is marked?

	To divide the name of the field use the symbol ;.
	Example:
	This;Field;Name		//3 lines

	You could also set the picture and width for each field.
The formats of the pictures are described in any xBase language.
	Example:
		Field: Money
		Picture: 999,999.99

	To finish changes press <font color="blue">F10</font>. Then you can press again <font color="blue">Ctrl+F2</font>
to restore all fields.

	The calculated fields will not be editable. Besides, they can
be used in expressions.

	The fields was marked as deleted (via <font color="blue">DEL</font>) will not be shown and
edited. <font color="blue">F8/<F7></font> blocks/unblocks all fields below current.

	The required order can be established by pressing <font color="blue">Ctrl+Up</font> or
<font color="blue">Ctrl+Down</font>.

	The required order and contents of fields can be established
consistently. Let's assume, we have removed from viewing some field.
And now we don't want to see another field, not only previous. Press
again <font color="blue">Ctrl+F2</font> (to restore all fields), again <font color="blue">Ctrl+F2</font>, then <font color="blue">F5</font> and
you can see previous established fields. Correct further, etc..

	Set Fields does not influent on "Copy TO" operation.

	 <h4> 10.Calculation of expressions.</h4>
<pre>

	By pressing <font color="blue">Shift+F6 (Alt+G(o), ?)</font> it is possible to calculate
almost any correct Clipper expression of length up to 255 symbols.
Not speaking about it is necessary to remember, what number was Date()-21
or quickly to take Log(Exp(1)) :-), it has turned out rather interesting
simulator for Clipper-programmer. It is possible, for example, to
experiment with parameters Memoedit, to understand, at last, than differs
Bin2i from Bin2w or to take an interest, that such Descend('½´·°°»®').

	It is possible to use almost all functions from Clipper.Lib and
Extend.Lib, number useful (on my sight) functions of known libraries
Six3, NanFor, Clipper Tools, Netto, Blinker, emulation of some functions
FoxPro, and also number of special functions BDBFS.
	The list of functions <a href="#pp4">see in SUPPLEMENT IV.</a>

<p><hr><a name="p11">
	 <h4> 11.Variables initialization.</h4>
<pre>

	By <font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font> you can initialize variable (or to set
it's new value).

	For simple variable it is necessary simply to execute assignment

		new=5
		word:='daddy'
		today=date()

	For the announcement of a array it should be described:

		arr[20] or arr=Array(20)

	Then it is possible to make Arr[3]=Exp(12.09).
	However, it is possible and directly to write:
		Arr := {10,20,'example'}

	Any correct Clipper expression are allowable in the right part.

	What for all this is necessary?

	You can, f.e. store result of previous operation and use it
	later.
		<font color="blue">F6</font>				// sum current field
		<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>	Sum1:=__sum	// store it

	It is sometimes convenient to calculate expression, and then it
to use in conditions. Using assignment variable and calculation
expressions it is possible even to write small programs. Try, f.e.,
to make following:
	<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>	aPrg=Array[Adir('*.prg ')]
	<font color="blue">Alt+G</font>		Adir('*.prg ', aPrg)
	<font color="blue">Alt+G</font>		ForAch (5,10,24, 'Program', aPrg)

	Selecting the index, which has non-standard extension.

	<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>	_oldind:='MyOwn.FIL '
	<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>	_req=0

	Choosing base from backup copies.

	<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>	_mask = '*.bak'
	<font color="blue">F4</font>


	Printing base with a fine font and with the slogan.

	<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>	_PSCode ='We are the champions ' +chr(15)
	<font color="blue">F2</font>

	It is possible to give the block of a code
	<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>	bck = {| i|i+1} , then
	<font color="blue">Alt+G</font>		Eval(num)


	Some examples are in Examples.Ini.

	 <h4> 12.Structure modifying.</h4>
<pre>

	After change of structure, previous version remains with
extension BAK. If there was a memo-file, it remains with extension TBK.

	If at updating there is a situation of numerical overflow,
it will be brought 0 in a field.

	In the program is realized known Clipper-trick - symbolical
fields with length more than 255 symbols. It is made so: in a field
Field_Dec enters Mod(Length, 256), in a field Field_Len - rest.
For example: length of a field is 700. Then Field_Dec=2, Field_Len=188.
But to enter necessary length in BDBFS it is enough to correct Field_len.
Then the necessary sizes will be brought automatically.

	<font color="blue">F9</font> (except for the driver SIXMDX) causes function of structure
optimization (like in OTTO utility from SIX-driver). It is made with
using VariField by the following rules:
	- All CHARACTER fields greater than 16 characters are
	  defaulted to 10 byte "V" fields. However, for short CHARACTER
	  fields, or those whose data is always a fixed length, you may
	  want to change them back to "C" types manually instead of using
	  "V" types.

	- All MEMO fields are defaulted to 6 byte "V" fields.

	- All NUMERIC fields greater than four bytes long and less than
	  11 bytes long are converted to four byte "I" (long integer
	  fields.

	- All 8 byte DATE fields are converted to 3 byte DATE fields.

	For non-English named fields see NATIONAL.TXT.

	 <h4> 13.Records inserting.</h4>
<pre>

	As is known, Clipper doesn't have the operation INSERT.
But sometimes it would be desirable very much. Therefore it is necessary
to go by heavy way: append, to move all downwards, to clear top. On the
large bases it can take long time. INSERT does not work with active INDEX
or TAG.

	- "ON" expression always equals IndexKey(0), so it doesn't work
	   in SORTed base;
	- ALL fields are copied to the new database (Clipper excludes
	   the memo-fields);
	- if field "TOTALCOUNT" exists, it will be filled with number of
	  totalled records on each key expression;
	- fields with alias (like base->fld1) aren't supported.

	 <h4> 15.Saving / restoring an environment.</h4>
<pre>

	You can define any variable, set conditions of search and
summation, specify an index and necessary fields etc., and
then save all this in a usual memo-file, having pressed <font color="blue">Shift+F1</font>.
	If then at any moment to press <font color="blue">Shift+F5</font> and to set a name of
this file, the all this environment, including used DBF, will be
(whenever possible) restored. Besides, it is possible at once to load an
environment, having set a name of MEM-file in a command line. Certainly,
can be as much as necessary files of an environment in the directory.

	The file BDBFS.MEM is used by default.
	If variable _AutoSave: =.T. is determined in a INI-file
(or directly from the program), the file BDBFS.MEM is created in the
current directory automatically at an exit.
	If variable _AutoRestore: =.T. is determined in a INI-file and
BDBFS.EXE is started without parameters, a file BDBFS.MEM from current
directory is read out automatically.

	 <h4> 16.Initialization files.</h4>
<pre>

	You can at loading or later, by pressing <font color="blue">Ctrl+F12</font>, to read
contents of a file of initialization. The file of initialization
represents from itself a usual text file, containing assignment variables,
and also, probably, performance of some functions, mini-programs.
	Variable will be then are accessible in the program.

	The following operations are determined:

	<h5>A. Assignment.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		&lt;var>:=&lt;expression>		or
		&lt;var> = &lt;expression>		or
		#define &lt;var> [&lt;expression>]

	Examples:
		MyVar=100
		MyVar := 100
		MyVar=Sqrt(4)
		#define MyVar 100

	In the latter case, as against of Clipper and C #include,
the variable will be announced and are accessible for all session time.
Default &lt;expression> for #define is .T..
	Can be useful the defining of code blocks in ini-file. Then they
can be used in program as functions.

	Example:
	//in ini-file
		Squart = {|i|  'the Area of a circle with radius '+STR(i,3)+;
				' = '+LTRIM(STR(3.1415 * i * i,16,2))}

	//in program
		{?} Squart(4) or
		{?} Eval(Squart,4)


	<h5>B. Function evaluation without assignment variable.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		=&lt;expression>	or
		&lt;expression>

	Examples:
		=Tone(440,3)
		Eval(bEval, 100)

	Keep in mind, that you must use =&lt;expression> form, when
symbol "=" is inside &lt;expression>, f.e.
		=Devout('S='+S)


	<h5>C. Including of another initialization file.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		#include &lt;FileSpec>

	The attention for Clipper & C programmers: the name of a file
could be given without inverted commas.

	&lt;FileSpec> may contain an explicit path and file name as well as a
file extension. If, however, no path is specified, bdbfs searches the
following places:

	- Current directory

	- Directories supplied in global variable _PlugDir
	  (default - &lt;place of bdbfs.exe>\plugins)

	- Directories specified in the INCLUDE environment variable.

	Examples:
		#include second.ini
		#include 'second.ini'
		#include c:\my\second.ini

	As the operation #define is supported, it is possible to
include standard Clipper .ch files, like inkey.ch, Set.ch.
Notice, that #define with parameters is not supported yet.


	<h5>D. User-defined command.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		#xcommand &lt;matchPattern> => &lt;resultPattern>

 &lt;matchPattern> is the pattern to match in the input text.

 &lt;resultPattern> is the text produced if a piece of input text matches
	 	the <matchPattern>.

	Patterns can include parameters (match markers). Match markers
are label and optional symbols delimited by angle brackets (&lt;>) that
provide a substitute (idMarker) to be used in the &lt;resultPattern> and
identify the clause for which it is a  substitute.
	As against commands of Clipper-preprocessor, only one parameter
(or absence of parameters) is supported.

	Examples:

	  #xCommand INVERT =>;
		    DBEval({||Rlock(),IF(DELE(),dbRecall(),dbDelete())})

	  #xCommand MODIFY COMMAND &lt;x> = > ModiFile(&lt;x>)

	  #xCommand EOM(&lt;x>) => FT_LDAY(&lt;x>)

	It is most natural to apply commands from calculation of
expressions, for example:
		{?} INVERT

	<h5>E. Defining of command's local table.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		#LOCALTABLE

	The commands defining by #xcommand operators occupate some memory
and slow down a little the calculation's execution (the substitution is
tested for each expression). So it is sometimes useful to free command's
table after execution.

	Example:
		#LOCALTABLE
		#include MyCmd.ch

	Suppose, the set of commands are defined in MyCmd. The
preliminary definition by #LOCALTABLE guarantees the clearing of
resources after ending of ini-file interpretation.


	<h5>F. MACRO keys definition.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		#MACRO &lt;key code> => &lt;a sequence of pressing>
		or
		#MACRO_IN_[scope] &lt;key code> => &lt;a sequence of pressing>

	The sequence of pressing can be given as symbolical line
(KEYBOARD format), or as a array of codes (INKEY format).
In the second case it is possible to set the functional and extended keys,
but length of a sequence is less or equal 16 symbols.

	Next scopes modifications could be given:

		#MACRO_IN_BROWSE - main mode,
		#MACRO_IN_DIALOG - dialogues of conditions and field list
		#MACRO_IN_FIELD  - GET mode
		#MACRO_IN_MEMO   - edition of memo-fields and text files

	If the scope isn't given the macro-key will be active in all modes.


	Examples:
		#MACRO 307 => {-9, 'F', 'A'}
		;Create HTML via menu on <font color="blue">Alt+<</font>.

		#MACRO_IN_FIELD 308 => "It we'll press quite often at
		edition"

		#MACRO_IN_DIALOG 383 => 'Like("*",&_C_F)'+REPL(CHR(19),9)
		;<font color="blue">Alt+*</font> suitable for pattern


	<h5>G. Announcement of the local variables.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		#LOCAL &lt;v1>,&lt;v2>...	or
		LOCAL &lt;v1>,&lt;v2>...

	If the variable isn't announced as local, it exist for the
duration of the program. Local variables are visible only within the
current ini-file.

	Example:
		#LOCAL cFile,nSum

	 Inline assignments are prohibited:
		LOCAL cX:=""		//Error!!!


	<h5>H. Execution's termination.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		#BREAK  or
		#BREAK &lt;condition>

	#BREAK without parameter forces the immediate termination of
the ini-file interpretation, #BREAK with &lt;condition> terminate the
interpretation if condition are valid:

	Example:
		#BREAK File("NeedFile")


	<h5>I. Parameters and return value.</h5><pre>

	Up to 5 parameters can be passed to ini-file. They are
accessible via _1.._5 identifier. Ini-file can return the value to
the calling process.
	Syntax:
		#RETURN &lt;expression>	or
		RETURN &lt;expression>

	Examples:
		#RETURN 4.
		#RETURN _1*_2+_3

	#RETURN doesn't terminate the interpretation, it only defines the
result. There can be more than one #RETURN in ini-file.

	The calling of ini-file with parameters is suitable from
calculation or user menu:

	{?} RestoreIni("MyPlug",Date(),"Example",2.4)

	You can use the recurrent RestoreIni(), so in "MyPlug" can be
written:

	RestoreIni("R2")
	and so on.

	Since the version 1.21 you can use the direct calling of ini-file
as a function:
	{?} MyPlug(par1,par2)

	Ini-file should have .ini extension in this case, that is
unessential in case of RestoreIni().


	<h5>J. Alternative execution.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		#IF &lt;lCondition>		(or IF &lt;lCondition>)
			&lt;statements>...
		#ELSE				(or ELSE)
			&lt;statements>...
		#ENDIF				(or ENDIF)

	It is the analogue of usual xBase IF..ENDIF statement.

	&lt;lCondition> is a logical control expression. If it evaluates to
true (.T.), all following statements are executed until an #ELSE or
#ENDIF is encountered.

	#ELSE identifies statements to execute if the #IF condition
evaluates to false (.F.).

	#IF...#ENDIF structures may be nested within other #IF...#ENDIF
structures up to 10 levels for one ini-file.

	Example:
		#IF Continue("Do you want to make something?")
			&lt;statements for "Something">
		#ELSE
			Nfind("May be next time...")
		#ENDIF

	The special cases of #IF operator are operators #IFDEF, #IFNDEF.
They are often used in Clipper #include files for prevention of repeated
loading.
	Examples:

	//in set.ch
	#ifndef _SET_CH
		... constants announcements

		#define _SET_CH
	#endif

	//in plugins\clipper.ch
	#IFDEF _CLIPPER_CH
		#BREAK		//yet another? No, Exit!
	#ENDIF
	...
	#DEFINE _CLIPPER_CH

	The symbol # is obligatory in #IFDEF, #IFNDEF.


	<h5>K. WHILE cycle.</h5><pre>

	Syntax:
		#WHILE &lt;lCondition>	or  WHILE &lt;lCondition>
			&lt;statements>...
		#ENDW[hile]		or ENDWHILE or #ENDDO or ENDDO


	It is the analogue of usual xBase WHILE..ENDWHILE statement.

	&lt;lCondition> is a logical control expression. If it evaluates to
true (.T.), all following statements are executed until an #ENDWHILE is
encountered.

	#WHILE...#ENDWHILE structures may be nested within other
#WHILE...#ENDWHILE structures up to 10 levels for one ini-file.

	Example:
		sum:=0
		#WHILE !EOF()
			sum:=sum+FieldGet(1)+FieldGet(2)
			DBSKIP()
		#ENDWHILE

<hr>

	You probably also will want to use functions For() and While() for
organization of cycling in ini-files <a href="#pp4for">(see SUPPLEMENT IV).</a>

	A lot of various examples are contained in the demonstration file
Examples.ini and in PLUGINS directory. <a href="#p32">See also ch.32.</a>

	At start of the program the attempt is made to read a file
BDBFS.INI, taking place in the program's start directory. If file of
initialization is not given in a command line, then the attempt is made
to consider a file BDBFS.INI, taking place in the current directory (at
its absence is searched BDBF.INI - for compatibility with the previous
versions of BDBF).

	If the file with extension .AOP (Auto Open) will be found in
the current directory, it will be read automatically when the base with
appropriate name will be opened. You can define some commands, variables,
menu <a href="#p30">(see ch.30)</a> specific for this base. Besides, you can define list of
necessary fields here. Fields list is given in variable FIELDS and
headers list in variable HEADS. Formats (show patterns) of fields can be
given in variable PICTURES. Width of each fields can be given in variable
Widths. Calculated fields can be also given.

	Example:

	Fields:={'Char','Num','Num*2'}
	Heads:={'Character;field','Numeric;field','Double value'}
	Pictures:={, '999,999.99'}
	Widths:={7,,,}

	You can also define other useful instruction (see also
<a href="#pp4">Supplement IV</a>). For example it's possible to set index or tag:
		_IndexFile:="MyIndex"		or
		__TagNom:=3			or
		__TagName:='MyTag'

	You can interactively define an index and necessary  fields
(via <font color="blue">Ctrl+F2</font>), and then save all this in AOP-file, by pressing
<font color="blue">Ctrl+Shift+F1</font>.

	Calling of any ini-file (f.e., via {<font color="blue">Ctrl+F12</font>}) results to
compulsory reopening of current base. If you do not wish it, you should
define variable lNoReOpen:=.T. in any place of ini-file.

	 <h4> 17.Macro-keys.</h4>
<pre>

	By pressing <font color="blue">Ctrl+F1</font> the sequence of symbols, saved in variable
_MACRO is called. In a mode VIEW this opportunity works as Set Key,
in edition - as Set Function.

		Example:

	<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font> _Macro=chr(4) +chr(4) +chr(13)

	Now, in a mode VIEW, by <font color="blue">Ctrl+F1</font> you will enter edition of a field
	CurrentField+2

	<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font> _macro ='Bravo!'

	Now, in a modes of edition, by <font color="blue">Ctrl+F1</font> in a field the text Bravo!
will be written down.
	It is convenient, when it is necessary in an interactive mode to
bring in many fields similar information.

	In a mode of edition the following macros are additionally
determined:
		<font color="blue">Alt+(</font>	=	() and cursor inside of brackets
		<font color="blue">Alt+)</font>	=	() and cursor outside
		<font color="blue">Alt+{</font>	=	{}
		<font color="blue">Alt+"</font>	=	[]
		<font color="blue">Alt+A</font>	=	.AND.
		<font color="blue">Alt+O</font>	=	.OR.
		<font color="blue">Alt+B</font>	=	{||}
		<font color="blue">Alt+C</font>	=	CTOD("//")

	It is especially convenient at definition of a condition.

	It is possible to define and own macros:

		<font color="blue">?</font> __SetFunction (&lt; a code of a key >, &lt; macros >),
or via <a href="#p16">command #MACRO</a> in ini-file.

	Besides in a mode of edition the "hot" keys are accessible
transformations of the current focus of input (same work and in VIEW):
		<font color="blue">Alt+U</font>	= UpperCase
		<font color="blue">Alt+L</font>	= Lower
		<font color="blue">Alt+K</font>	= Capitalize (Proper)
		<font color="blue">Alt+Q</font>	= English -> National (if you casually have typed
			  something in "English" keyboard instead of
			  "National").
		<font color="blue">Alt+Y</font>	= on the contrary.

<pre>

	It's possible to use the internal or external editor for edition
of memo-fields, and also external files (by pressing F4 in filer or
through the menu "File" - "Modify text"). The internal editor uses
standard function MemoEdit and works when variable _MemoEditor is not
given (for example, in an ini-file). Variable can be given as String, for
example, _MemoEditor:='c:\medit\me.exe' (then always will be used
MultiEdit) or as an array of arrays:

	{Field's Mask,			// f.e "BM*"
	 External editor,		// f.e. "ME"
	 Shift in a memo-field,		// by default 0 - whole field
	 The additional options,	// by default are absent
	 Temporary file			// by default $$BDBF$$.COM }.

	The external editor can be not given, then it is supposed, that
the program(for example, screen-saver) resides in a memo-field, and this
program simply is started. The shift in a memo-field is necessary to set,
if the memo-field keeps the diverse information. For example, animals.dbf
in Delphi's distributive contains a field BMP, where a picture is stored
from 9 positions.

Example:
	_MemoEditor:={	{'BMP', 'pv', 9, '/d'},;
			{'SAVER', '', 0, ",'tmp.com"},;
			{'*','ME ', 0, "};
		     }
	So, PV.EXE will be called on a field with the name BMP,
the field SAVER contains executable programs, and for edition all rest
will be called MultiEdit.

	The internal editor can't edit files with the size more than
64K. But also at use of the external editor it is necessary to remember,
that the memo-fields of a format DBT are not capable to store the section
more 64K. If your file has large length, at recording it in a field of a
format DBT it will be cut off.

	 <h4> 28.Printing forms.</h4>
<pre>

	Besides a usual printing on <font color="blue">F2</font>, since the version 1.13,
it is possible to use special definitions for a report forms. Form are
stored in usual textual files and contain instructions for definitions of
columns, groupings, summarizing, etc.

	Report forms can use the following variables:

	_aExpr - array of expressions for each column.
	_aHead - array of column's headings. Default == _aExpr
	_aElen - array of column's widths. Default = width of a field

	If _aElen is default, width of a column is defined as maximal
between _aElen, width of column heading and _aPict for this column. If
width of a field is more, than width of a column, it is made correct
carry (up to 10 lines in a column) on separators:
		space tabulation . , ; ? !

	_aPict	 - array of pictures for each column.

	_aTitle	 - report title. Default - nothing. Can be given as a
		   string or array of strings.

	_cFile	 - output file. Default - name of base + '.PRN'.

	_aSum	 - array of necessity of summation for each column.

	_fCondit - print condition.

	_aFooter - name of additional procedure printing a form footer or
		   array containing the footer.

	_pEveryStep - name of additional procedure or block called
		      before a printing of each line satisfying to a
		      condition _fCondit

	_aGroup - array specifying report group.
		Structure of a array:
		{
		&lt;expression of grouping>,;
		[&lt;an array or block for a printing of group heading>],;
		[&lt;an array or block for a printing of group footer>]
		[&lt;logical: print the group sum only if more than 1 element
		 are in group>]
		}.
		Default for group heading:
			'Code' + &lt;expression of a grouping>.
		Default for group footer: "Total:".
		Default for a printing of the sum: .F. (to print the sum
		always).

	_nDouble - attribute of necessity of a printing in two columns on
		   a sheet. If 0 or is not given - one is printed. If
		   numerical parameter is given - is perceived as
		   amount of blanks between two columns.

	_NoShow - don't offer a file for viewing and printing.

	_aPage - array specifying grouping on page.
		Structure:
		{
		 [&lt;an array or block for a printing of page heading>],;
		 [&lt;an array or block for a printing of page footer>]
		}.
	If it's determined, the totals of page are printed. Header
	of page is printed, since second.

	cDivideT, cDivide - delimiter of columns in the header and
		information lines accordingly (default - ':').

	_nCounter - if > 0, a serial line number is printed at the left
		    side of sheet (with width _nCounter).

	CountName - name of a column for serial number (default "NN").
		    It is meaningful only if _nCounter > 0 is given.

	_PrintZero - whether to print of zero values, by default - .F.

Following variables can be additionally adjusted directly from the
programs (by pressing <font color="blue">F9</font> in dialogue of a beginning of a printing).

	Printing of heading on each page	_NeedHeadPage
	Printing of numbers of pages		_NeedPrPage
	Page eject after each sheet		_NeedEject
	Starting sequence of the printer	_PSCode
	Final sequence of the printer		_PECode
	The left margin				_LMargin
	Page length (0=tape)			_Plength
	Whether to print the standard heading	_NeedMainHead
	The printer device			_printer
	Whether to append to a file		_NeedApFile


Report-form files have standard extension .BPF and can be loaded through
the menu "Base" - "Read report template".

<pre>

	Besides the general menu, in BDBFS it is possible to define
the additional user menu accessible by <font color="blue">F12</font>. For this purpose it is
necessary in ini-file to define two arrays: UserMenuPrompts and
UserMenuActs. First it is necessary to fill by lines offered on a choice
in the menu, in second - by the appropriate blocks of a code. For example,
you want to have an opportunity to start FoxPro from BDBFS. Then in
BDBFS.INI it is necessary to write down:

	UserMenuPrompts: = {'Call FoxPro '}
	UserMenuActs: = {{|| BliRun('Fox.exe')}}.

	Some examples are in Examples.Ini.

	 <h4> 32.Plug-ins.</h4>
<pre>

	 "Plug-ins" of bdbfs are usual ini-files <a href="#p16">(see ch.16)</a>, realizing
some completed function. Some examples (probably useful) are in
PLUGINS\ directory. Send me your plug-ins, best will be published.

	Bdbfs searches for Plug-ins (and #include)-files:
		- in current directory;
		- in directories supplied in global variable _PlugDir
		  (default - &lt;place of bdbfs.exe>\plugins). You can
		  define(f.e. in bdbfs.ini) more than one directory:
			_PlugDir:='c:\bdbfs\plugins; d:\MyOwn\plugins'
		- in directories specified in the INCLUDE environment
		  variable.

	You can use the plug-ins as usual function, if they have default
extension .INI.  Suppose, you have MyPlug.ini.
It is then possible, f.e.:

	{?} MyPlug()			//Calculate current

	{CTRL+F5} xVar:=MyPlug()*2      //Assignment

	{F7} MyPlug() > 100		//Searching

Plug-in could have up to 5 parameters.

	Example:
		MyPlug(2,3,'Hello')

	If you need call the plug-in from another plug-in, or plug-in
has non-standard extension, you should use the function RestoreIni().

	Example:
		RestoreIni('MyPlug',2,3,'Hello')

	 <h4> 33.Start BDBFS.</h4>
<pre>

	You can use the mask (with symbols * and ?) at starting.
The files will be offered for a choice.
	Example:
		 BDBFS *.Str
Files with extension STR will be offered.

	Parameter /i = &lt;indexname> sets loading a file together with
specified index.

	Parameter /BW adjusts colors to monochrome.

	The order of parameters /BW and /i = can be alternated.

	At start with a parameter - name of a file of an environment
the attempt is made to restore this environment. Similarly, with a file of
initialization - see <a href="#p15">ch.15</a> and <a href="#p16">ch.16.</a>

	Example:
	 	BDBFS Envr.mem


	The parameters /NTX /CDX /MDX /NSX set the default RDD (usually
it defined in bdbfs.ini). You can use also /SIX[driver] form.

	Examples:
		BDBFS MyBase /SIXNSX

		BDBFS MyBase /ntx /i=char

	The parameter /CREATE allows to begin the work with a creating of
a new database.

	Example:
		BDBFS MyNew /CREATE


	Besides there are some parameters forcing BDBFS to work in
batch mode - REINDEX, HTML, PACK, CHECK and variety of STRUCT_ parameter.
In batch mode BDBFS carries out given operation and finishes the work.


	Parameter REINDEX causes reindexing of a base. A compound index
(CDX, NSX, MDX) reindexes automatically, for reindexing of simple index
it should be specified in third parameter with a key /i. If any
index is not found, the appropriate message will be shown.

	Examples:
		BDBFS f_w_cdx REINDEX
		BDBFS f_w_ntx /REINDEX /i=MyNtx.ntx


	Parameter HTM (HTML) causes production of a HTML file.

	Examples:
		BDBFS MyDbf HTM			//MyDbf.htm is generated
		BDBFS MyDbf /HTML=e:\1		//e:\1.htm is generated

	If HTML file exists you will be asked for rewriting.
So if you wish to rewrite existing HTML without confirming, destroy it
before!


	Parameter PACK causes packing of a base.


	Parameter PRINT causes initialization of BPF-file <a href="#p28">(see ch.28).</a>

	Examples:
		BDBFS Customer /PRINT		//Customer.BPF used
		BDBFS Customer /PRINT=Annual	//Annual.BPF used

	Parameter STRUCT_ allows to execute all file operations with
database structure, usually allowable from DISPLAY STRUCTURE mode (<font color="blue">Alt+F2</font>).
	Variety of parameter:
		STRUCT_PRINT	- print the structure description to
				  print device
		STRUCT_FILE	- print the structure description to
				  file (database.STP)
		STRUCT_EXTENDED	- create the file in COPY STRU EXTENDED
				  format (database.STE)
		STRUCT_COPY	- create the empty file of same structure
				  (database.STR)
		STRUCT_PROGRAM	- create the program generating this
				  structure and tags of compound index,
				  if it exists (database.STG).

	All postfix of STRUCT_ parameter can be reduced up to 4 symbols.

	Example:
		BDBFS MyDbf /STRUCT_PROG


	Parameter CHECK causes testing of a base size <a href="#p31">(see ch.31).</a>


	Parameter FORCED causes "forced" mode <a href="#p34">(see ch.34).</a>

	It is possible to apply the command FOR to work with the
catalogue.

	Examples:
// Reindex all
		FOR %a in (*.DBF) DO bdbfs %a REINDEX

// To create HTMLs in subdirectory _HTMLS_
		echo y | DEL _HTMLS_\*.HTM
		FOR %%a in (*.DBF) DO bdbfs %%a HTM=_HTMLS_\%%a
		REN _HTMLS_\*.DBF _HTMLS_\*.HTM

The happy owners of 4DOS can save the command (and time):
		DEL /y _HTMLS_\*.HTM
		FOR %a in (*.DBF) DO bdbfs %a HTM=_HTMLS_\%@NAME[%a]

//To make the database documentation
		FOR %%a in (*.DBF) DO BDBFS %%a /STRUCT_FILE
		ECHO Databases of system > All_Dbf.txt
		FOR %%a in (*.STP) DO COPY All_DBF.TXT+%%a All_Dbf.TXT
		DEL *.STP

	 <h4> 34.Forced mode.</h4>
<pre>

	BDBFS supports different formats of DBF via so called RDD of
CLIPPER. On the other hand, many formats recently have appeared, which are
not supported via RDD (at least, I haven't such RDD).
	They are: new fields and headers of Visual FoxPro, dBASE5, FlagShip,
FlexMemo. Besides, there are some programs, calling the fields "wrongly",
f.e. beginning with figure.
	Therefore, I wrote the special "forced" mode in BDBFS, allowing
to process such bases without RDD. For this purpose the heading of base
is corrected "in flight" to supported of RDD and is restored after all
works.

	So, in "forced" mode BDBFS supports the following formats:

	- Visual FoxPro (field types Currency, DateTime, Binary, Integer,
	  Double, Picture, General, new memo-format, new header format);
	- dBASE4, dBASE5 (field type Bitmap, new headers);
	- FlagShip (field types 2,4,8, new headers);
	- FoxBase 1.0 (old header);
	- FlexMemo (new memo-format);
	- and, potentially, all another possible (and unknown to me)
	  field types, which will be processed as Character in this case.

	Non-standard field names are transformed by the following rules:

	- if there are Code Page FoxPro 1200-1299 in header,
	  AnsiToOem() executed;
	- non-alphabetical and non-digital symbols are replaced
	  by symbol "_".
	- if the name begins with figure, it is anticipated with "_".

	"Forced" mode can be applied also for processing of bases with
"long" (>64K) memo-fields, as use of standard drivers in this case causes
the internal error of Clipper.

	For today the following restrictions work:

	- the base is used only in an exclusive mode;
	- PACK-operation is prohibited if the base contains memo-fields;
	- MODIFY STRUCTURE-operation is prohibited;
	- in a memo-field it is possible to write down up to 64K
	  and standard way SX_Blob2File/SX_File2Blob does not work.

	"Forced" mode can be activated from command line via parameter
/FORCED (f.e. bdbfs MyBase /forced) or by setting of variable _lForced:=.T.
in ini-file.

	 For access to some "non-standard" types of fields (f.e., at use
in expressions, searches) it is necessary to use special functions (usual
edition, viewing, replacement of additional efforts not require):

	- Memo, Picture, Bitmap - types
		MemoSrc(&lt;field_name>) - returns the string
	- Currency - type
		YToCurs(&lt;field_name>) - returns the number
	- DateTime - type
		TToC(&lt;field_name>) - returns the string
	- Binary - type
		CToF(&lt;field_name>) - returns the number
	- 2 - type
		Bin2I(&lt;field_name>) - returns the number

	Example:
// Set filter to field Cur1 of type "Currency"

	   <font color="blue">Alt+F</font> YToCurs(Cur1)>100

	Once again I remind, for processing of base in the forced mode,
it is necessary to correct its heading! Therefore, if, f.e., the power
will be lost or current window will be closed during the works, the
structure of base will be corrupted (in case of Visual FoxPro even rather
essentially).

	<h4>37.Known problems.</h4>
<pre>

	Besides again found out mistakes, there is a number of known
problems, which, probably, will be eliminated in the future.

	- the new formats of Visual FoxPro,DBASE4,DBASE5,FlagShip,FlexMemo
	  are supported in "forced" mode <a href="#p34">(see ch.34)</a>;

	- #define with parameters in ini-files is not supported;
	- #xCommand with more, than one parameter is not supported;

	- problems with MDX indexes (restriction of the driver):
	  - the wildseek in indexes is not accessible;
	  - number of a key in an index and quantity of records in
	    the filter (without calculation) are not accessible. It is
	    reflected in correctness of indicators showing;

ÿ ÿ ÿ ÿ - long names in filer are shown up to 16-symbols.

	- a nonrestorable mistake "Disk overflow" during COPY or APPEND
	  operation.

	- due to mistake in realization of TBROWSE object,
	  not all fields in base can be shown. By default,
	  quantity of fields, are shown in BDBFS is limited to 170
	  (experimental limit on my computer is 173). You can
	  experiment by setting _nBrowMaxField variable in a INI-file.

	- internal error 1112. It appears on database with
	  long memo-fields (more than 64K). It's Clipper 5.2 fault (in
	  5.0 it wasn't). You can exclude such fields from viewing
	  in AutoOpen files <a href="#p16">(see ch.16)</a> (and access them via
	  Sx_Blob2File() function) or use "forced" mode <a href="#p34">(see ch.34).</a>

	- FoxPro's indexes with expression like alias.field instead
	  alias->field cause the error when index field is changed.

	- noncompact IDX-s are not supported (restriction of SIX3
	  driver).

	- SEEK doesn't work in FoxPro indexes made with established
	  SET COLLATE.

	 <h5>B.Called functions.</h5><pre>

	It is possible to call any internal function BDBFS, as well as
system in any modes. It looks more natural to use this in a mode of
calculation (<font color="blue">Shift+F6, Alt+G, ?</font>),or in a mode of assignment (<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>).

	Examples:
		<font color="blue">Alt+G</font>		Aver('Example')
		<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>	avrg=Aver('Example')

	For presentation of the explanatory we shall conduct on
	educational base

	NAME	S02	S03	S04
	Your	12	1	13
	Your1	32	2	33
	My	10	3	10
	My1	30	4	0


<h6>1. Functions of calculation.</h6><pre>

<hr>
		SUM( &lt;cExpr> [, &lt;cCond>] ) - > nResult

	Sum base on expression cExpr for a condition cCond.
	Returns Number.

	Examples:
		<font color="blue">Alt+G</font>	(1)	Sum ('S02+S03', '[My] $ Name')
			(2)	Sum ('S02', '.t.')


	(1) will return 47	(2) - 84

	If &lt;cCond> is omitted, the scope is all records.

	Except for returned value the result is remembered in variable
		__Sum

<hr>
		AVER(&lt; cExpr > [, &lt; cCond >]) - > nResult

	Calculates average on expression cExpr for a condition cCond.
	Returns Number.

	If second parameter is omitted, it is meant .t.

	Example:
		<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>  MediumS2=Aver('S02', '[My] $ Name')

		will return 21

<hr>
		COUN(&lt; cCond >) - > nResult

	Counts up quantity of records satisfying to a condition cCond.

	Example:
		<font color="blue">Ctrl+F5</font>  CntMy=Coun ('[My] $ Name')

		will return 2

	If second parameter is omitted, it is meant .t.

	Except for returned value the result is remembered in variable
		__count

<hr>
		SumLine([&lt;FromField>], [&lt;ToField>]) - > nResult

	Summarizes fields "lengthways" records, from &lt;FromField> up to
&lt;ToField>. Default FromField is first field, ToField - last field.
	The non-numerical fields are ignored.

	Examples: (for the first record)
		SumLine()	- > 26
		SumLine(1,2)	- > 12
		SumLine(3)	- > 14

	Except for returned value the result is remembered in variable
		__Go
<hr>
		Like(&lt;cEtalon>, &lt;cTest>)

	Determines whether or not a character expression is contained in
another expression. LIKE() returns true (.T.) if &lt;cEtalon> matches
&lt;cTest>. &lt;cEtalon> can contain the wildcard characters * and ?. The
question mark matches any single character in &lt;cTest> and the asterisk
matches any number of characters. You can mix any number of wildcard
characters in any combination in &lt;cEtalon>. The function has shown the
same high-speed results, as same function of Clipper Tools (probably,
algorithm is same). But EXE is 0.5K less :-) .

	Examples:
		<font color="blue">F7</font> Like ('spr*.dbf', FileName)

		<font color="blue">Alt+G</font> Like ('?m*h', 'smith') - > .t.

<hr>
		Crc32(&lt; cExpr >)

	Calculates the control sum of a line.
	The algorithm of PKZIP is used.

	Example: the control sum of all fields:
		Crc32(Name+XTOC(s02) +XTOC(s03) +XTOC(s04))

<hr>
		Rand([&lt; nExpr >])

	Returns a random number in a range from 0 up to 1.
	From everyone ExprN the identical sequence comes back.

	Example: Rand(Seconds())

<hr>
		Random(&lt; nMin >, &lt; nMax >)

	Returns random integer in range from nMin up to nMax.

	Example: Random(0,1000)

<hr>
		RoundIt(&lt;nVar>,&lt;nPlace)

	Correct rounding off. Clipper not always correctly carries out
operation of a rounding off.

	Example:
		Round(1.025,2)		-->	1.02
		RoundIt(1.025,2)	-->	1.03


<h6>2. Functions of transformation</h6><pre>

<hr>
		Capitalz(&lt;cExpr>) - > ExprC

	Returns the specified character expression with initial letter
capitalized and the remaining characters lowercase.

	Returns the empty line if parameter is absent.

	Example:
		Capitalz('LUGANSK')	- >  Lugansk

<hr>
		OemToAnsi(&lt;cExpr>)

	Converts each character in a character expression to the
corresponding character in the ANSI character set (default: 1251).

	You can change the char set to your own, to change variables
	_Oem_Set, _Ansi_Set in BDBFS.INI.

	Example:
		OemToAnsi('')	--> ËÓÃÀÍÑÊ

<hr>
		AnsiToOem(&lt;cExpr>)

	Inverse function to OemToAnsi() .

<hr>
		SplitLine(&lt;cExpr>)

	Transform the specified character expression to an array.
	Array's elements are separated by points.

	Example:
		SplitLine('One,Two,Three') - > {'One', 'Two', 'Three'}

<hr>
<a name="pp4dbTrans">		dbTrans(cNewBase, Fields [, bFor, bWhile, nNext, lRest])

	Copies the current base with an opportunity of renaming or
transformation of fields.
	The list of fields is set in inverted commas (as a line), or as
the array (that is necessary at the giving of expressions with points).
	If the calculated fields are not given in the list of fields, the
function works completely as system command COPY.
	See also <a href="#p5">topic 5.Append/Copy</a> of the present description.

	Examples:
		DBTrans('NewFile','Char,Num AS Digit,Num*2 AS Double')

		DBTrans('NewFile',{'LEFT(Char,2) AS Symbol','Num'},;
			{||Num # 0})

<hr>
<a name="pp4Tb2Html">		TB2Html([cHtmlFile, cTitle, aDesign])

	Transforms the current TBrowse object to a format HTML.
If the name of a file is not given - it is requested. An array
of colors aDesign has structure:
		{page background color,
		table background,
		text color for table and header,
		text color for deleted records}.
	Default: "navy","blue","white","red".

		Example:

		Tb2Html('MyBase','WWW FOREVER!',;
			{'fffffc0','fffff80','00000ff','black'})


<h6>3. Other.</h6><pre>

<hr>
		ModiFile(cFileName)	- > .T. at successful record

	Elementary text editor. As uses MemoEdit, it can edits files up
to 64K. In conditions of small amount of memory, this size can decrease.

		Example:
			ModiFile('c:\config.Sys')

<hr>
		Scatter()

	Writes down contents of the current record in a array with a name
_Scatter. The attribute of deleting enters in last element of an array.

<hr>
		Gather()

	Writes down in the current record an array with a name _Scatter,
usually created by function Scatter().

<hr>
		SWAP(recno1, recno2)

	Exchanges the contents of records with physical numbers
recno1, recno2 through the internal buffer.

		Example:

		WORK(HEAD) - > cResult

	Defines the true name of a field on heading.
It is useful in case of the setting of fields by <font color="blue">Ctrl+F2</font>, when you
don't remember the real field's name, and its name should be specified,
for example, in the search expression.

		Example:
			Work('My name for 2 field') - > 'S02'

<hr>
		FindMax(NeedMax [, FieldName], [EvalBlock]) - > MaxVal

	Universal function of searching of a maximum / minimum.
		Parameters:
			NeedMax - .T., if the maximum is necessary,
				  .F. - minimum
			FieldName - field or expression, by default -
				    current field.
			EvalBlock - block of a code calculated for
				    comparison, by default - value
				    FieldName ({|i| i})

		Examples:

			FindMax(.T.,'S02 ') - > 32

			FindMax(.F.,'S02 ') - > 10

// Length the longest name

		FindMax(.T.,'Name ',{|i |Len(Trim (i))}) -> 5
		(is found ' Your1 ')

<hr>
		PrintEdit([cFileName])

	Prints the current record on the device of a printing
(default-printer) in an unwrapped kind.
	By pressing <font color="blue">Alt+P</font> in BDBFS - into the file with a name
&lt;CurrentBase>.Rec.
	Appending/rewriting of a file depends on the appropriate
adjustment printer.

<a NAME="pp4for">
		For(&lt; nFrom >, &lt; nTo >, &lt; bEval >, &lt; bFor > )

	"FOR" cycle. Could be useful, for example, in INI-files.
Codeblock bEval is executed when Eval(bFor)==.T..
The cycle variable is transferred to the bEval and bFor as parameter.
bEval and bFor can be of Codeblock or Character type.

	Examples:
		cSet:=''
		For(1,254,{|_1|cSet:=cSet+CHR(_1)}) --> '...þ'

		nSum:=0
		For(1,FCOUNT(),{|i| nSum:=nSum+FIELDGET(i)**2},;
		    {|i| VALTYPE(i)=='N'})

		nSum:=0
		For(1,FCOUNT(), "nSum:=nSum+MyField**2")

	Some examples are in PLUGINS directory.

<hr>
		While(&lt;bCondition>, &lt;bEval> [,&lt;bFor>] [,&lt;lBase>])

	"WHILE" cycle. If lBase==.T., SKIP is executed after each bEval.
	bCondition, bEval and bFor can be of Codeblock or Character type.

	Example:
		cName:=''
		While( '!EOF()', {|| cName+= Name},,.T.)

	Result:	'YourYour1MyMy1'

		cName:=''
		While( '!EOF()', {|| cName+= Name},'s02<30',.T.)

	Result:	'YourMy'

	Some examples are in PLUGINS directory.
