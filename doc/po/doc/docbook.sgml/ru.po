"The basic currency of SGML is the\n"
"<firstterm>tag</firstterm>.  A simple tag consists of a\n"
"pair of angle brackets and the name of the tag.  For\n"
"example, the <sgmltag>para</sgmltag> tag would appear in\n"
"an SGML document as <sgmltag\n"
"class=\"starttag\">para</sgmltag>.  This start tag indicates\n"
"that the immediately following text should be classified\n"
"according to the tag.  In regular SGML, each opening tag\n"
"must have a matching end tag to show where the start tag's\n"

"<quote><literal>/&gt;</literal></quote>, e.g.,\n"
"<sgmltag>&lt;xref/&gt;</sgmltag>.  However, use of this\n"

"DocBook is giving specific elements a name, or an ID, so\n"
