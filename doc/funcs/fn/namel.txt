   General purpose string to length+string packet function
$SYNTAX$

   fn_NameL( cName, nRequiredLength)  => cReturn

$ARGUMENTS$

   <cName>	 - the character string to be used (shouldn't be longer
		than 255 characters
   <nLength> -  if specified, the String is padded with NULLs
		    to this length

$RETURNS$

   <cReturn> - a character string with a one byte word at the beginning
  which indicates the string length, including a null terminator
  which is added if it does not exist.

$DESCRIPTION$

   There are numerous places where a character string that is sent
   needs to be encoded with a leading BYTE specifying the length
   and may also need to be padded with NULLs.

   A terminating null is guaranteed.

   If the Length of cName is greater than nRequiredLength -1,
   it is truncated to leave room for the terminator.
