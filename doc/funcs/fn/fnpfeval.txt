$ONELINER$
   Set preferred server and eval block
$SYNTAX$

   fn_pfEval( xID, bBlock ) --> xRet

$ARGUMENTS$

   <xID> can be numeric, or a character.

   If it's numeric, it is the connection ID of the server you want
   to set to before evaluating <bBlock>.  This is is position of
   the server in the server name table. You can use FN_FSNAME()
   to find a connection ID, given a server name.  If the
   connection ID is invalid, the current connection ID is used.

   If it's a character, it is the _name_ of the server you want
   to set to before evaluating <bBlock>.  If the server name is
   invalid or not found, the current server is used.

   <bBlock> is a code block to evaluate.

$RETURNS$

   <xVal>, whatever is returned from the block when it is
   evaluated.

$DESCRIPTION$

   Some APIs require you to set to a preferred connection ID first
   before they can be executed.  This call just simplifies the
   process of getting the old ID, setting the new one, doing
   something, then resetting the old ID.

   This function records the state of fn_error() after evaluating
   the block and makes sure it stays that way before returning.
   Therefore, you can't really know whether or not the calls to
   change the preferred server back and forth are working or not,
   as there is no way to access their return values.
