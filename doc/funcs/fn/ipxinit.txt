$DESCRIPTION$

    This function initializes an array in the library
    with the address of the IPX services. This function must be
    called before any of the IPX functions in this library can be
    performed.

    [This function is meant to be part of a larger suite but
    the code wasn't ready by the release date.  In its present
    form, it can be used to determine if IPX is installed,
    which might be useful.]
