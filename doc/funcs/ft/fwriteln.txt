$FUNCNAME$
   FT_FWRITELN()
$CATEGORY$
   File I/O
$ONELINER$
   Write a line to the currently selected text file
$SYNTAX$

   FT_FWRITELN( < cData >, [ < lInsert > ] ) -> lSuccess

$ARGUMENTS$

   <cData> is a string of data to write to the file at the current
    record position.

   <lInsert> is a logical indicating whether the contents
   of the current record are to be preserved, that is, if lInsert
   evaluates to .T., the a new record is inserted at the current
   position.  The current record then is pushed down to FT_FRECNO()+1.

   If lInsert is .F. or omitted, the current record is replaced by
   cData.

$RETURNS$

   TRUE if successful, otherwise check ^ft_fError()^n for error code.

$DESCRIPTION$

   This function writes a line of text to the file in the currently
   selected text file workarea.  Text lines are delimited with a
   CRLF pair.  The record pointer is not moved.

   The contents of the current record are updated to reflect the new
   new line written, unless the Insert option is selected.

   Writing a null string has the effect of clearing the current line
   if in overstrike mode, else inserting a new line (same as
   FT_FINSERT()).

   A text file "record" is a line of text terminated by a CRLF pair.

$EXAMPLES$

   // write a line of text to a file

   FT_FUSE( "config.sys" )

   DO WHILE UPPER( FT_FREADLN() ) != "FILES=" .AND. !F_FEOF()

      FT_FSKIP()

   ENDDO

   FT_FWRITELN( "FILES=30", FT_FEOF() )
