$FUNCNAME$
   FT_FUSE()
$CATEGORY$
   File I/O
$ONELINER$
   Open or close a text file for use by the FT_F* functions
$SYNTAX$

   FT_FUSE( [ <cFile> ] [, <nMode> ] ) -> nHandle | 0

$ARGUMENTS$

   ^b<cFile>^n is the text file you want to open.  If not specified,
   the file currently open, if any, will be closed.

   ^b<nMode>^n is the open mode for the file.  Please refer to the
   discussion of open modes under FOPEN() in the Clipper manual
   and FILEIO.CH for a list of allowable open modes.  If not
   specified, the file will be opened with a mode of
   FO_READ + FO_SHARED (64).

$RETURNS$

   If ^b<cFile>^n is passed and the file is opened successfully, an
   integer containing the text file's workarea.  If the file cannot be
   opened, -1 will be returned.  In this case, check the return value
   of ^bft_fError()^n for the cause of the error.

   If FT_FUSE() is called without any arguments, it will close the
   text file in the current "text area" and return 0.

   If a read error occurs ^ft_fError()^n will contain the error code.

$DESCRIPTION$

   The FT_F*() file functions are for reading text files, that is,
   files where each line (record) is delimited by a CRLF pair.

   Each file is opened in its own "workarea", similar to the concept
   use by dbf files.  As provided, a maximum of 10 files (in 10
   workareas) can be opened (assuming there are sufficient file
   handles available).  That number may be increased by modifying
   the #define TEXT_WORKAREAS in the C source code and recompiling.

$EXAMPLES$

   #include "fileio.ch"

   // open a text file for reading
   ft_fUse( "text.txt" )

   // open a text file for reading and writing
   ft_fUse( "text.txt", FO_READWRITE + FO_SHARED )

   // close file
   ft_fUse()
